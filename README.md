# News Aggregator

The goal of this project is to develop an application that can gather the most recent news from the various APIs offered by various news agencies, summarize it, and present it to readers in such a way that they can get the gist of the news and remain up to date with recent events that have occurred around them and in the fields that interest them, respectively.

Background: There is a multitude of websites spread out around the internet that may make the most recent news easily accessible to you. The problem with them, however, is that they are produced by a variety of news agencies, each of which focuses on reporting on a certain subject (for example: ESPN in sports). 

The user would be relieved of the hassle if there was a platform that could integrate the news from various sources and offer it to them, so that they wouldn't have to go to numerous platforms if they have multiple fields of interest.
